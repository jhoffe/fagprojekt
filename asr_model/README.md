# ASR model
This directory contains the code for the ASR model. The model itself is in `asr/modules/asr_model.py`, and
the code for the training and validation loop are in the `runner.py` file. The entrypoints for running these pieces of
code are `load_model.py` and `experiment_uniform_batching.py`.
